# openpad

Very old laravel app where I was playing with a bunch of webtorrent, webrtc, and other p2p stuff in the web browser. It also implements a reddit like submission system for urls, files, torrents, etc... and there is a (probably broken now) interface for voting on the posts, and a sorting algorithm based on the vote counts. each post also can accept comments, similar to reddit. the comments also have the same voting & ranking algorithms applied to them. 

Shit documentation.
Very messy code.
Probably UI and JavaScript won't work 100% if you try to set it up today

But there is some useful code in here nonetheless (particularly the voting ranking backend code, the comment system backend, url parsing, etc...)

Feel free to pick apart & salvage whatever you want, and let me know if you have any questions!
